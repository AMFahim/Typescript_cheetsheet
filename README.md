 WELCOME TO TYPESCRIPT UNIVERSE
=======================================


What is Typescript?
---------------------
> Typescript is a supterset of Javascript. It's give the type checking facilities. The Browser can't run typscript code. Ultimately the typscript code compiles as javascript.Typescript gives static type checking facilities. With the static type checking we get potential bug when we type the code. We can write proper documented code with typescript.That makes easier to maintenance our large scale project.

Basic types in Typescript.
----------------------
There are main three types of primitive data type in typescript.
>1. boolean
>2. String
>3. Number

#### Boolean
boolean means it will return only true or false. 


```typescript
let isOpen:boolean = "false";
```
#### String
String data types means it will return text value.

```typescript
let firstName:string = "John Doe";
```

#### Number
Number data types means it will return all numberic and float values

```typescript
let rollNo:number = 10;
```

#### Type Assignment
Typescript assign type in two ways.
1. Implicit
2. Explicit

##### Explicit:
 When we write the static type of the variable. It is Explicit type.

 ```typescript
let firstName:string = "John Doe"; //Explicit type
```

##### Implicit:
When we not write any type, typscript by default detect the type based on the asigned value. It is Implicit type. 

 ```typescript
let firstName = "John Doe"; //Implicit type
```
